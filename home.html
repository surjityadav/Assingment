        <h2 class="home-h2">This weekends's special brunch</h2>
        <p>
          This weekend our season of special brunches continues with scrambled egg on an English muffin. Not for the faint-hearted, the secret to these eggs is that they are made with half cream and cooked in butter, with no more than four eggs in the pan at a time.
